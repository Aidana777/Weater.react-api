# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**Project Overview: Weather Dashboard Application**

The Weather Dashboard Application is a web-based tool designed to provide users with current weather data and forecasts for cities around the world. It offers a simple and intuitive interface where users can search for a city and instantly retrieve detailed weather information.

**Key Features:**

1. **Real-Time Weather Data:** The application integrates with a weather API to fetch up-to-date weather information for the specified city.

2. **Search Functionality:** Users can easily search for a city by entering its name into the search bar. The application then displays the current weather conditions for that city.

3. **Input Validation and Error Handling:** Robust input validation ensures that users provide valid city names. The application handles invalid or empty search queries gracefully by displaying appropriate error messages.

4. **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

5. **Intuitive User Interface:** With a clean and user-friendly interface, users can quickly access the weather data they need without any unnecessary complexity.

6. **Favorite Cities (Bonus Feature - Optional):** Users have the option to save their favorite cities for quick access. This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to easily track weather conditions for frequently visited locations.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript (React.js)
- **API Integration:** Axios for making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Responsive Design:** CSS media queries for ensuring compatibility across different screen sizes.
- **Local Storage (Optional):** Utilized for storing favorite cities if the bonus feature is implemented.

**Project Setup:**

To set up and run the Weather Dashboard Application locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the application.

**Usage:**

1. Upon loading the application, users are presented with a search bar to enter the name of the city they want to retrieve weather data for.
2. After entering a city name and submitting the form, the application fetches the weather data for that city and displays it on the interface.
3. Input validation ensures that only valid city names are accepted, while error handling gracefully manages invalid or empty search queries.
4. Users can interact with the application seamlessly across various devices, thanks to its responsive design.

**Conclusion:**

The Weather Dashboard Application provides users with a convenient and efficient way to access real-time weather information for any city worldwide. With its intuitive interface, robust functionality, and responsive design, it offers a seamless user experience for staying informed about weather conditions anywhere, anytime.
